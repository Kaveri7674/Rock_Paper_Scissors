Here's a simple and secure password generator in Python that allows customization like length and character types:

import random
import string

def generate_password(length=12, use_uppercase=True, use_digits=True, use_specials=True):
    # Base character set (lowercase letters)
    characters = list(string.ascii_lowercase)
    
    # Add character types based on user preferences
    if use_uppercase:
        characters += list(string.ascii_uppercase)
    if use_digits:
        characters += list(string.digits)
    if use_specials:
        characters += list(string.punctuation)

    # Ensure there's at least one character of each selected type
    password = []
    if use_uppercase:
        password.append(random.choice(string.ascii_uppercase))
    if use_digits:
        password.append(random.choice(string.digits))
    if use_specials:
        password.append(random.choice(string.p
